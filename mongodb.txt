               MongoDB: Used to store large amount of data permanently
---------------------------------------------
 1. Difference between SQL and MongoDB

                  SQL                                                       MongoDB 
-----------------------------------------             -----------------------------------------------------
        - Relational DBMS                                  - Document orienter NoSQL DB
        - store in table with row and columns              - Collection of JSON Documents
        - uses fixed schema                                - use dynamic schema
        - used to optimize complex join and                - optimized for scalability and performance
          transaction
        - support rich set of data types                   - limited set of data types
        - declarative query language                       - expressive query language based on JSON
        - ACID (Atomicity, consistency, isolation          - NoSQL based on CAP (consistency, availability and 
          and Durability) property                           partition tolerance) property
        - uses Traditional business application            - used in big data and real time web application

 2. Commands in MongoDB - CRUD
     - show databases:  display all dbs
     - use db-name: redirect to a particular db 
     - show collections: display all collections
     - find(): to get all Documents from a collection
     - find(argument): to get all documents which satisfy the condition from a collection 
     - findOne(condition): get only single document which satisfy the condition else return null         
     - limit(count): to limit document while reading from db
     - sort(): to sort documents based on any key
     - countDocuments(): to get totsl number of documents in a collection
     - insertMany(array of documents): insert more document at the same time
     - insertOne(): insert single document at a time
     - updateMany(): update more document at the same time
     - updateOne(): update a single document
     - deleteOne(): delete a single document
     - deleteMany(): delete more document at the same time
     - Query Commands
         - $gt/gte/lt/lte 
         - &and/&or
         - &eq/$ne
         - $in/$nin
         - $exists
         - $set
         - $push
         - $pull
     - Aggregation: Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed results
         -$lookup: syntax
          collection.aggregate({$lookup:
          {
            from: <collection to join>,
            localField:<field from the input documents>,
            foreignField:<field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
            as: <output array field>
          }
          })
  3. Mongoose: MongoDB ODM (Object database modelling)
    - used to translate the code and its representation from MongoDB to the Node.js server.
    - Advantages of Mongoose module:
       - Collection validation of the MongoDB database can be done easily.
       - Predinfed structure can be implemented on the collection.
       - Constraints can be applied to documents of collections using Mongoose.
